<h2>Historical Vote Totals and Win Margins</h2>

<p> To put Dilma's 2014 win margin in historical perspective, here is a chart of presidential vote totals since democratization. She beat Aécio by 3.4 million votes (3.28 percent), which would be huge by US popular vote standards (cough: electoral college). <br>
  * = Indicates winner <br>
  ** = Indicates winner in the first round
